# Experimental Windows containers support

As from `v0.13`, Buildkit now has experimental support for Windows containers (WCOW). Both `buildctl.exe` and `buildkitd.exe` binaries are being released for testing purposes.

We will apprecate any feedback by [opening an issue here](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/issues/new), as we stabilize the product, especially `buildkitd.exe`.

## Quick start guide

### Platform requirements

- Architecture: `amd64`, `arm64` (binaries available but not officially tested yet).
- Supported OS: Windows Server 2019, Windows Server 2022, Windows 11.
- Base images: `ServerCore:ltsc2019`, `ServerCore:ltsc2022`, `NanoServer:ltsc2022`. See the [compatibility map here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/windowscontainers/deploy-containers/version-compatibility?tabs=windows-server-2019%2Cwindows-11#windows-server-host-os-compatibility).

### Setup Instructions

**Dependency:** `containerd` v1.7.7+

> **NOTE:** all these requires running as admin (elevated) on a PowerShell terminal.

Make sure that `Containers` feature is enabled. (_`Microsoft-Hyper-V` is a bonus but not necessarily needed for our current guide. Also it's depended on your virtualization platform setup._) Run:

```powershell
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V, Containers -All
```

You will be asked to restart your machine, do so, and then continue with the rest of the steps. No other restart needed.

1. Setup `containerd` by following [the setup instructions here](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md#installing-containerd-on-windows). (_Currently, we only support the `containerd` worker_.)
1. Setup the CNI, see details in the [CNI / Networking Setup](#cni--networking-setup) section.
1. Start the `containerd` service, if not yet started.
1. Download and extract:
    ```powershell
    $url = "https://api.github.com/repos/moby/buildkit/releases/latest"
    $version = (Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $url -UseBasicParsing).tag_name
    $arch = "amd64" # arm64 binary available too
    curl.exe -fSLO https://github.com/moby/buildkit/releases/download/$version/buildkit-$version.windows-$arch.tar.gz
    # there could be another `.\bin` directory from containerd instructions
    # you can move those
    mv bin bin2
    tar.exe xvf .\buildkit-$version.windows-$arch.tar.gz
    ## x bin/
    ## x bin/buildctl.exe
    ## x bin/buildkitd.exe
    ```
1. Setup `buildkit` binaries:
    ```powershell
    # after the binaries are extracted in the bin directory
    # move them to an appropriate path in your $Env:PATH directories or:
    Copy-Item -Path ".\bin" -Destination "$Env:ProgramFiles\buildkit" -Recurse -Force
    # add `buildkitd.exe` and `buildctl.exe` binaries in the $Env:PATH
    $Path = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", "Machine") + `
        [IO.Path]::PathSeparator + "$Env:ProgramFiles\buildkit"
    [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable( "Path", $Path, "Machine")
    $Env:Path = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","Machine") + ";" + `
        [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path","User")
    ```
1. Start `buildkitd.exe`, you should see something similar to:

    ```
    PS C:\> buildkitd.exe
    time="2024-02-26T10:42:16+03:00" level=warning msg="using null network as the default"
    time="2024-02-26T10:42:16+03:00" level=info msg="found worker \"zcy8j5dyjn3gztjv6gv9kn037\", labels=map[org.mobyproject.buildkit.worker.containerd.namespace:buildkit org.mobyproject.buildkit.worker.containerd.uuid:c30661c1-5115-45de-9277-a6386185a283 org.mobyproject.buildkit.worker.executor:containerd org.mobyproject.buildkit.worker.hostname:[deducted] org.mobyproject.buildkit.worker.network: org.mobyproject.buildkit.worker.selinux.enabled:false org.mobyproject.buildkit.worker.snapshotter:windows], platforms=[windows/amd64]"
    time="2024-02-26T10:42:16+03:00" level=info msg="found 1 workers, default=\"zcy8j5dyjn3gztjv6gv9kn037\""
    time="2024-02-26T10:42:16+03:00" level=warning msg="currently, only the default worker can be used."
    time="2024-02-26T10:42:16+03:00" level=info msg="running server on //./pipe/buildkitd"
    ```

    **Running `buildkitd` with the CNI:**

    Note that the above simple run will not have the networking bit setup;
    for instance you won't be able to access the internet from the builds e.g. downloading resources.

    Follow the instructions in the [CNI / Networking Setup](#cni--networking-setup) section.
    Once that is done, you can now start `buildkitd` providing the binary and config paths to the flags.
    These are the same paths used by `containerd` too:

    ```powershell
    buildkitd `
        --containerd-cni-config-path="C:\Program Files\containerd\cni\conf\0-containerd-nat.conf" `
        --containerd-cni-binary-dir="C:\Program Files\containerd\cni\bin"
    ```
   
    > **NOTE:** the above CNI paths are now set by default, you can now just run `buildkitd`.

    You can also run `buildkitd` as a _Windows Service_:

    ```powershell
    buildkitd `
        --register-service `
        --service-name buildkitd `
        --containerd-cni-config-path="C:\Program Files\containerd\cni\conf\0-containerd-nat.conf" `
        --containerd-cni-binary-dir="C:\Program Files\containerd\cni\bin" `
        --debug `
        --log-file="C:\Windows\Temp\buildkitd.log
    ```

    > **NOTE:** the above `log-file` path is just an example, but make sure to set up
    > your logs properly.

    `buildkitd` on Windows depends on `containerd`. You can make the above registered `buildkitd` service
    dependent on `containerd` (the naming may vary). The space after `=` is required:

    ```powershell
    sc.exe config buildkitd depend= containerd
    ```

    We can also set the service to start automatically:

    ```powershell
    Set-Service -StartupType Automatic buildkitd
    ```

1. In another terminal (still elevated), try out a `buildctl` command to test that the setup is good:
    ```
    PS> buildctl debug info
    BuildKit: github.com/moby/buildkit v0.0.0+unknown
    ```
    > **NOTE:** the version is `v0.0.0+unknown` since this is still a _release candidate (RC)_.

### Example Build

Now that everything is setup, let's build a [simple _hello world_ image](https://github.com/docker-library/hello-world/blob/master/amd64/hello-world/nanoserver-ltsc2022/Dockerfile).

1. Create a directory called `sample_dockerfile`:
    ```powershell
    mkdir sample_dockerfile
    cd sample_dockerfile
    ```

1. Inside it, add files `dockerfile` and `hello.txt`:
    ```powershell
    Set-Content Dockerfile @"
    FROM mcr.microsoft.com/windows/nanoserver:ltsc2022
    USER ContainerAdministrator
    COPY hello.txt C:/
    RUN echo "Goodbye!" >> hello.txt
    CMD ["cmd", "/C", "type C:\\hello.txt"]
    "@

    Set-Content hello.txt @"
    Hello from buildkit!
    This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
    "@
    ```

    > **NOTE:** Writing to a file directly under `C:\` needs extra permissions that are `ContainerAdministrator`.
    > The `ContainerUser` is default user for `nanoserver` image. See more details at [#4731](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/issues/4731).

1. Build and push to your registry (or set to `push=false`). For Docker Hub, make sure you've done `docker login`. See more details on registry configuration [here](../README.md#imageregistry)

    ```powershell
    buildctl build `
    --frontend=dockerfile.v0 `
    --local context=. \ `
    --local dockerfile=. `
    --output type=image,name=docker.io/<your_username>/hello-buildkit,push=true
    ```

    You should see a similar output:

    ```

> **NOTE:** After pushing to the registry, you can use your image with any other clients to spin off containers, e.g. `docker run`, `ctr run`, `nerdctl run`, etc.

## Running `buildctl` from a Non-Admin Terminal

The default case for running `buildctl` is from an admin (elevated) terminal.
If you attempt running in a non-admin terminal, you will get an `Access Denied`
error, on the named pipe:

```
connection error: desc = "transport: Error while dialing: open \\\\.\\pipe\\buildkitd: Access is denied."
```

However, it is possible to run it in a non-admin terminal by providing
the group name(s) of the users executing the command.

You can find the group names that the current user belongs too by running:

```cmd
whoami /groups
```

You can also create a group and add the user on it by running the following in
an admin terminal:

```powershell
# you can use $env:USERNAME for PowerShell or
# %USERNAME% for CMD terminal
net localgroup buildkit-users <username> /add
```
NOTE: You will need to log out and log in for the changes to reflect.

Once you have the group(s), you can supply it as part of the `--group` flag when starting
`buildkitd` (still in an admin termainal). If it is more than one group, comma-separate them. Example:

```powershell
buildkitd --group="USERBOX-1\buildkit-users"
```

With this now, you can run `buildctl` in a non-admin terminal.

## CNI / Networking Setup

Below is a simple setup based on the `nat` network that comes by default, with enabling the
_containers_ and _Hyper-V_ features.

```powershell
# get the CNI plugins (binaries)
$cniPluginVersion = "0.3.1"
$cniBinDir = "$env:ProgramFiles\containerd\cni\bin"
mkdir $cniBinDir -Force
curl.exe -fSLO https://github.com/microsoft/windows-container-networking/releases/download/v$cniPluginVersion/windows-container-networking-cni-amd64-v$cniPluginVersion.zip
tar xvf windows-container-networking-cni-amd64-v$cniPluginVersion.zip -C $cniBinDir

# NOTE: depending on your host setup, the IPs may change after restart
# you can only run this script from here to end for a refresh.
# without downloading the binaries again.

$cniVersion = "1.0.0"
$cniConfPath = "$env:ProgramFiles\containerd\cni\conf\0-containerd-nat.conf"

$networkName = 'nat'
# Get-HnsNetwork is available once you have enabled the 'Hyper-V Host Compute Service' feature
# which must have been done at the Quick setup above
# Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V, Containers -All
# the default one named `nat` should be available, except for WS2019, see notes below.
$natInfo = Get-HnsNetwork -ErrorAction Ignore | Where-Object { $_.Name -eq $networkName }
if ($null -eq $natInfo) {
    throw "NAT network not found, check if you enabled containers, Hyper-V features and restarted the machine"
}
$gateway = $natInfo.Subnets[0].GatewayAddress
$subnet = $natInfo.Subnets[0].AddressPrefix

$natConfig = @"
{
    "cniVersion": "$cniVersion",
    "name": "$networkName",
    "type": "nat",
    "master": "Ethernet",
    "ipam": {
        "subnet": "$subnet",
        "routes": [
            {
                "gateway": "$gateway"
            }
        ]
    },
    "capabilities": {
        "portMappings": true,
        "dns": true
    }
}
"@
Set-Content -Path $cniConfPath -Value $natConfig
# take a look
cat $cniConfPath

# quick test with nanoserver:ltsc20YY (YMMV)
$YY = 22
ctr i pull mcr.microsoft.com/windows/nanoserver:ltsc20$YY
ctr run --rm --cni mcr.microsoft.com/windows/nanoserver:ltsc20$YY cni-test cmd /C curl -I example.com
```

> [!NOTE]
> **Notes for WS2019:**
> For cases where there is no default NAT network, like in WS2019 or even when you delete one
> and you would like to recreate. You can set this up with the following:

```powershell
# Assumption: you have enabled Hyper-V and Containers features and restarted
# Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Hyper-V, Containers -All

# get the HNS module that has the New-HnsNetwork function.
curl.exe -fSLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/SDN/master/Kubernetes/windows/hns.psm1
Import-Module -Force ./hns.psm1

$adapter = Get-NetAdapter | where { $_.InterfaceDescription -eq 'Microsoft Hyper-V Network Adapter' }

New-HnsNetwork -Type NAT -Name nat -AdapterName $adapter.Name
```

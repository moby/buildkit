title: buildkitd.toml
---

The TOML file used to configure the buildkitd daemon settings has a short
list of global settings followed by a series of sections for specific areas
of daemon configuration.

The file path is `/etc/buildkit/buildkitd.toml` for rootful mode,
`~/.config/buildkit/buildkitd.toml` for rootless mode.

The following is a complete `buildkitd.toml` configuration example.
Note that some configuration options are only useful in edge cases.

```toml
# debug enables additional debug logging
debug = true
# trace enables additional trace logging (very verbose, with potential performance impacts)
trace = true

# buildkitd.toml

## NAME

buildkitd.toml - configuration file for buildkitd


## DESCRIPTION

The TOML file used to configure the buildkitd daemon settings has a short
list of global settings followed by a series of sections for specific areas
of daemon configuration.

The file path is `/etc/buildkit/buildkitd.toml` for rootful mode,
`~/.config/buildkit/buildkitd.toml` for rootless mode.

## EXAMPLE

The following is a complete **buildkitd.toml** configuration example,
please note some of the configuration is only good for edge cases, please
take care of it carefully.
